## 2D Ball Fight Animation Creation Software 
Inspired by ball fighting videos online (see earclacks)

Includes a variety of ball shaped characters with weapons 
who battle it out in the arena. Uses PyGame. Sprites made by me.
Unfortunately I didn't feel like relearning how to derive 2D collision physics so I took that from online (mostly wikipedia).

For fun project - Kiyan Bates
